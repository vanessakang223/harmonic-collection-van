     <p class="heading">Swiss Typographic Style</p>
   

     <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="marginsnew">International Typographic Design begins with a <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/grid-design/">mathematical grid.</a> These grids are considered to be the “most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.
      ”Using a grid for design makes creating a hierarchy for the content much easier.
        <p class="marginsnew">The movement’s innovators combined elements of other artistic trends to create the beauty and simplicity of the Swiss Style that we know today. Elements from Bauhaus, De Stijl and The New Typography are sprinkled throughout the works of Ersnt Keller, Max Bill, Josef-Müller Brakmann and Armin Hofmann—i.e., the pioneers of Swiss Style.</p></div>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p class="marginsnew">The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning.The high modernist style that started developing in Russia, the Netherlands and Germany in the 1920s was an inspiration for Swiss Design. From around 1914 to 1940, design styles like Suprematism and Constructivism, The Bauhaus school, and De Stijl were prominent all over Europe. Russian Suprematism and Constructivism was inspired by the revolution and the socialist era. De Stijl in the Netherlands used mathematical solutions and grids for composition. The Bauhaus School in Germany went after a variation of Constructivism that also influenced architecture.

      The common denominator of these styles is the use of simple geometric shapes and sans serif typography with very unusual placements. Grids became an essential tool for organization. The International Typographic Style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the Basel School of Design in 1908. "</p>
     
     <h1>Typefaces</h1>
       
        <p class="marginsnew">Appreciating Swiss Style means appreciating the typefaces that started it all. Those grid systems wouldn’t be anything without the classic sans serif typeface that so seamlessly folds into Swiss Style. Those who taught Swiss Style argued that design should focus on the content and not decorative extras. By stripping away the embellishments, Swiss Style eliminates distractions for the viewer and allows the information-heavy design to be read and studied rather than merely seen and admired.

        <h1>The Designers</h1>
        <p class="marginsnew"><a href"https://www.moma.org/artists/3041"></a>Ernst Keller</a>, lovingly known as the “father of Swiss design.” The year is 1918 and Keller just received a teaching position at the Kunstgewerbeschule (literally translated “arts and crafts school”) in Switzerland.His teachings mark the beginning of the grid systems for which Swiss Style is known, and his belief that design should adapt to content placed focus on the importance of typefaces. Little did Keller know, some of his students would become the forefront runners in the creation of the International Typographic Style movement. Shall we call them the sons of Swiss Style?
